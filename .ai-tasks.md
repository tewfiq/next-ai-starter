# .ai-tasks.md

This file outlines a detailed list of tasks for an AI coding agent to build and integrate a complete Next.js application, with a particular focus on generating reusable UI components and their corresponding Storybook stories.

---

## 1. Project Setup

- [ ] **Initialize the Next.js Project**
  - Use Create Next App to generate the project with TypeScript, the App Router, and Tailwind CSS.
  - Enable strict mode in TypeScript.

- [ ] **Configure Basic Routing**
  - Create a Home Page (e.g., `pages/index.tsx`) for user input.
  - Create a Greeting Page (e.g., `pages/greeting.tsx`) to display a personalized message.

---

## 2. Creating Functional Pages

### 2.1 Home Page – Name Input

- [ ] **Create the Home Page (`pages/index.tsx`)**
  - Render a form containing:
    - A text input where the user can enter their name.
    - A submit button labeled "Submit", styled using Tailwind CSS.
  
- [ ] **Implement Form Handling**
  - Use the `useState` hook to manage the input value.
  - Validate that the input is not empty before submission.
  - Upon form submission, navigate to the Greeting Page, passing the name via query parameters or a state management solution.

### 2.2 Greeting Page – Display Message

- [ ] **Create the Greeting Page (`pages/greeting.tsx`)**
  - Retrieve the user’s name from the query parameters or shared state.
  - Display a greeting message in the format "Hello, {name}" with appropriate styling using Tailwind CSS.
  
- [ ] **Ensure Correct Navigation**
  - Verify that the form submission on the Home Page correctly redirects to the Greeting Page with the transmitted name.

---

## 3. Validation and Interactive Testing

- [ ] **Form Validation**
  - Prevent form submission if the input is empty.
  - Display an error message (e.g., "Please enter your name.") when validation fails.

- [ ] **Manual User Flow Testing**
  - Enter a name, verify the redirection, and confirm that the Greeting Page displays the correct message.

## 4. Storybook Integration and UI Component Creation

The goal is to generate reusable UI components along with their Storybook stories for visualization and testing.

### 4.1 Setting Up Storybook

- [ ] **Install and Configure Storybook**
  - Add Storybook as a development dependency (e.g., `npm install --save-dev @storybook/react`).
  - Create the Storybook configuration (e.g., a `main.ts` file in the `.storybook/` directory) and ensure compatibility with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

### 4.2 Creating UI Components and Their Stories

#### Button Component

- [ ] **Create the Button Component**
  - File: `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`
  - Implement a functional component accepting at least the following props:
    - `label`: the button text.
    - `onClick`: a callback function for click events.
    - `disabled`: a flag indicating the disabled state.
  - Handle various states (default, hover, focus, disabled) using Tailwind CSS.

- [ ] **Generate a Story for the Button**
  - File: `src/stories/Button.stories.tsx`
  - Define multiple variants:
    - **Default**: Standard button displaying "Click Me".
    - **Hover**: Simulated hover state.
    - **Disabled**: Disabled button with appropriate styling.

#### Input Component

- [ ] **Create the Input Component**
  - File: `src/components/ui/Input.tsx`
  - Implement a controlled component with the following props:
    - `value`
    - `onChange`
    - `placeholder`
    - `error` (to display an error message and style when validation fails).

- [ ] **Generate a Story for the Input**
  - File: `src/stories/Input.stories.tsx`
  - Create scenarios for:
    - **Empty Field**: Display the placeholder.
    - **Filled Field**: Show a predefined value.
    - **Validation Error**: Display the error message and adjust styling.

#### Additional UI Components (e.g., Card, Modal)

- [ ] **Identify and Create Additional Necessary Components**
  - For each additional component (e.g., `Card`, `Modal`), create a file in `src/components/ui/` and clearly define its props and various states (normal, active, error, etc.).

- [ ] **Generate Corresponding Stories**
  - For each component, create a Storybook file in `src/stories/` that documents all variants and interactions.

## 5. Workflow Automation with AI Code Assistants

- [ ] **Update This Instruction File**
  - Ensure that this `.ai-tasks.md` file is up-to-date and accurately reflects all tasks for the AI coding agent.

- [ ] **Trigger the Automated Workflow**
  - After completing each task, run a build (`npm run build`), commit the changes with a descriptive message, and update this file by checking off the completed tasks.
  - Do not take a screenshot after each story.
  - If additional details are needed for any task, gather all relevant files and pass the full file to the research agent.

This detailed plan will guide the AI coding agent to develop a complete Next.js application with integrated UI components and their Storybook stories. Follow each step carefully and update the task file as tasks are completed.
